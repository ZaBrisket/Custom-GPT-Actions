# Actions Guide

These OpenAPI specs are tailored for the GPT Builder. Each file has exactly **one server domain** to avoid duplicate-domain conflicts. 
Import **one file at a time** in GPT Builder → Actions.

**Workspace owners** can restrict Action domains (Admin → GPTs → GPT Actions). Make sure the domains in `compliance/domain-allowlist.txt` are permitted.

For OpenAI's official steps for creating GPTs, configuring Actions, and managing domain allowlists, see the help doc "Creating a GPT" (Configure tab, Capabilities, and Custom Actions).
